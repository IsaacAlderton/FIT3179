        <h1>Global Emissions, Energy and Population Statistics</h1>
        <p>One of the major contributing factors to climate change is the creation of CO2 emissons from fossil fuels. 
          This visualisation explores trends of CO2 emission production and population growth on a global scale.</p>

          <p>The countries with the highest CO2 emissions per capita in 2021 were <strong>Australia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, 
            the USA, Mongolia and Oman,</strong> all with levels greater than 14.5 tonnes of CO2 per capita. The orthographic 
            projection depicts that the continents of Africa and South America created a relatively low amount of CO2 
            emissions from fossil fuels per capita when compared to those of North America, Asia, and Oceania.
          Emission trends are further explored in the following bubble plot; select different years from 
            the dropdown box to visualise global changes in CO2 emission production over time.</p>

          <p>In the year 1980, <strong>the USA</strong> produced the largest amount of CO2 emissions in the world with approximately 
          <strong>4,800 Mt</strong>. <font color="purple">North America</font> also dominated other metrics with Sint Maarten producing 85.11 tonnes of CO2 per 
            capita and Curacao possessing the highest emissions per unit of land area, with 30,647 t/km^2.</p>
          <p>Fast forward to 2021; <strong>China</strong> overtook the USA to produce the the highest amount of total CO2 emissions 
            with a value of <strong>11,472 Mt</strong>, Qatar holds the global emissions density high with 35.5 tonnes per capita, 
            and Jordan produced the largest amount of CO2 per unit of land area with 213,281 t/km^2. This highlights 
            the extend to which <font color="red">Asia's</font> CO2 emissions outgrew those of <font color="purple">North America</font> from 1980 to 2021, to become the 
            continent with the largest contribution to CO2 emissions around the world.</p>
          <h2>Quantifying Change Over Time</h2>
          <p>The following charts depict the composition of the different sources of CO2 emissions over time, and the 
          percentage change in global emissions and population from 1980 to 2021 by continent. <strong>Select each source</strong> in 
          the CO2 Emission Sources area chart legend to highlight their relative contribution to global emissions.</p>

          <p>The CO2 Emission Sources area chart shows that <font color="orange">Coal</font> and <font color="red">Oil</font> comprise the majority of total emissions 
          from 1980 to 2021. <font color="orange">Coal</font> emissions grew from <font color="orange">7024 Mt in 1980 to 14976 Mt in 2021</font>, while <font color="red">Oil</font> emissions grew 
          from <font color="red">8499 Mt to 10802 Mt</font>. <font color="orange">Coal</font> surpassed <font color="red">Oil</font> as the largest single CO2 emissions source in the world between 
          the years 2000 and 2010. The amount of emissions from all of the listed sources increased over the specified 
          time period.</p>
          <p>The Growth Over Time bar chart compares trends of emissions and population growth by continent. Asia's CO2
          <font color="orange">emissions growth</font> greatly exceeded its <font color="green">population growth</font>, with emissions increasing by approximately 
          48,000 % from 1980 to 2021, and population increasing by 7,500 %. Africa had the second highest emissions 
          growth and the highest population growth. All other continents' <font color="orange">emissions growth</font> was greater than their <font color="green">population growth</font> 
          except for Europe, which actually saw a 282.3 % decrease in total CO2 emissions between 1980 and 2021.</p>

          <h2>What About Renewable Energy?</h2>
          <p>Hover over the Global Electricity Generation Sources line chart to see the amount of electricity generated 
          from each source (<font color="brown">fossil fuels</font>, <font color="red">nuclear</font>, <font color="blue">renewables</font>) for each year between 2000 and 2020. Since the turn of the 
          century, <font color="brown">fossil fuels</font> have dominated electricity production, and continued to rise steadily to a peak value of 
          14,886 TWh in 2018 before slightly dropping off to 14,369 TWh in 2020.</p> 
          <p>The next largest source of electricity generation is <font color="blue">renewables</font>, such as wind, solar, and hydro. Starting at just over 
            2,000 TWh in 2000, the contribution of renewables to global electricity production has increased at steadily increasing 
            rate, as indicated by the rising slope of the <font color="blue">renewables</font> line on the chart, to a value of 6,971 TWh in 2020. This 
            indicates the world's growing reliance on using renewable sources to generate electricity. <font color="red">Nuclear</font> energy production has 
            remained around the 2,000 TWh mark during each year from 2000 to 2020, inclusive.</p>

          <p>The Electricity Generation and Consumption dot plots depict the relationship between energy consumption per capita 
          and renewable energy generation per capita for each continent. <strong>Select a year in the legend</strong> to highlight its corresponding 
          data points, and pan and zoom the display areas to further explore the trends. <strong>NOTE:</strong> No data for Europe exists for this metric.</p>
          <p>Cycling through each year from 2000 to 2020 shows that, on average, the majority of points for each continent move 
            diagonally upwards and to the right, indicating an <strong>increase in both energy consumption and renewable electricity generation 
            per capita over time</strong>.</p> 
          <p>The dot plots for Asia, North America and South America are concentrated higher on the y-axis than 
          those for Africa and Oceania, which suggests a higher renewable energy generating capacity relative to the total amount of energy 
          consumed per person in these continents. The continent of <strong>Africa</strong> has the <strong>lowest energy consumption per capita</strong>.</p>
          <p><strong>Bhutan</strong>, a country within Asia, recorded the <strong>highest renewable energy generation capacity</strong> in the world in <font color="green">2020</font> with an amount of 
            3,026.4 kWh per person, while Qatar, also within Asia, recorded the highest global energy consumption per capita with 
            245,271.8 kWh per person in <font color="purple">2015</font>.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> </p>
          <h2>In Summary</h2>
          <p>Since 1980, global CO2 emissions, population, and renewable energy generation capacity have all seen significant increases. 
          As the world becomes more climate conscious, the analysis of emissions-related data will become more and more important, and 
          is likely to contribute to the slowing of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and a growing reliance on renewable energy for a safer,
          cleaner, and greener world.</p>
